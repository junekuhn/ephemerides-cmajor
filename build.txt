midi CC
vol - 0
shape - 1
adsr - 2, 3, 4, 5
algo - 6
num/denom/div - 7,8,9
glide - 10
base - 11
drone - 12

other potential features 
- over C / Under C / etc. 
- quantisation of base frequency - done



notes
everything should be in std, like std::oscillators::Shape::sawtoothUp

it seems that there's no way to implement a selection / option without a custom gui 
i need to look at event to see if there are discrete options 
input sine.shapeIn; was all I needed

Language feature not yet implemented: Exposing child endpoints which use processor arrays!
Language feature not yet implemented: top-level arrays of inputs!
exposing shape choice to gui

converting float64 to float32?

displace index
center is c3 - 60
we want to extend from c2 to c4

the state variables aren't updating, why?  I can't get the algorithm selection to stay

looking at the graph there's two instances of freqCalculator, one in the voices, and another that's global. I can try passing 

hoisted endpoints don't work for arrays

for holdmode we ignore all noteoff events, turning noteon into a toggle

the voice allocator doesn't work with droneMode in the way that I intend

not sure yet if I can use a button to turn off all voices

cmajor patches don't by default export interfaces
