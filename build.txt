waveform select
envelope
move voice to separate graph 
voice allocator & top level param
algorithm enum / input
4. portamento
5. microtonal functions
6. interface development


other potential features 
- over C / Under C / etc. 
- quantisation of base frequency 



notes
everything should be in std, like std::oscillators::Shape::sawtoothUp

it seems that there's no way to implement a selection / option without a custom gui 
i need to look at event to see if there are discrete options 
input sine.shapeIn; was all I needed

Language feature not yet implemented: Exposing child endpoints which use processor arrays!
Language feature not yet implemented: top-level arrays of inputs!
exposing shape choice to gui

converting float64 to float32?
