there's a few things I want to outline for the interface design

1. I want to take into account some post-human principles
    absolute restriction and minimization
2. I want to be able to use Glove midi 
3. it looks like I still need a keyboard interface of at least 12 keys, up to 24 or so before it becomes a bit awkward

When I'm playing, what do I do? 

- Algorithm switching
- switching hold mode constantly
- brief taps to give off effects
- the ASDR wasn't working very well 

1. Given an algorithm, top, divisor, and bottom selected:
    - disperse the notes in space, rotation, and pose 

2. Given a selected of notes 
    - disperse configuration params, but also the notes in space, rotation, and pose 
    - env trigger
    - remove note from drone

3. hold mode
