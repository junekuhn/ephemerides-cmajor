1. waveform generation
2. interface for waveform generation
3. test functions 
3. multi-voice allocation
4. portamento
5. microtonal functions
6. interface development


notes
everything should be in std, like std::oscillators::Shape::sawtoothUp

it seems that there's no way to implement a selection / option without a custom gui 
i need to look at event to see if there are discrete options 
input sine.shapeIn; was all I needed
